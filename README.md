👋 Hey there! I'm Sanchez Wesley Odhiambo
💻 Computer Science Student | Aspiring Developer | Future Cybersecurity Enthusiast 🚀
Currently perfecting Java & diving into Android Development with Kotlin! 🛠️
Still trying to figure out Git—I push code, hoping for the best. 😂
Debugging skills: 80% guessing, 20% Googling.

📌 Goals:

Become a Kotlin king 👑📱

Build awesome Android apps (hopefully ones that don’t crash every 5 mins 😅)

Eventually, hack... ethically 🕵️‍♂️👀

☕ If I’m not coding, I’m either watching anime, gaming, or wondering why I chose this path in life 😂
"If it works, don't ask why. Just push to GitHub and run." 🏃
