👋 Hey there! I'm Sanchez Wesley Odhiambo 

💻 Computer Science Student | Aspiring Developer | Future Cybersecurity Enthusiast
🚀 Currently perfecting Java & JavaScript, diving into React soon!
🛠️ Still trying to figure out Git—I push code, hoping for the best.
😂 Debugging skills: 80% guessing, 20% Googling.

📌 Goals:

Become a JavaScript wizard 🧙‍♂️✨

Master React by August (or let React master me)

Eventually, hack... ethically 🕵️‍♂️👀


☕ If I’m not coding, I’m either watching anime, gaming, or wondering why I chose this path in life😂
